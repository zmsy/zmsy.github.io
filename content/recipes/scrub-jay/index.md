A beautiful vinegar reduction sauce can be the absolute star of an savory dish; retaining some its hallmark sour flavor, but taking on a sweeter and more viscous form. It adds a tart counterpoint to an otherwise rich meal.

In the Scrub-Jay, a vinegar reduction plays a similar role, but is used to add some additional character to a normally dark and spirit-forward drink. The end result is a well-rounded, savory take on an old-fashioned that give it a distinctly unique appeal.

## Making the Reduction

For the reduction, you're looking for a **ratio of 4 parts Apple Cider Vinegar to 1 part Maple Syrup**. Alternately, you can sub 20g of sugar for any 1 part Maple Syrup (if you want to use a different sweetener).

Starting with a wide saucepan on medium heat, you add in the ingredients to the reduction and simmer them until reduced by the desired amount (notes in the recipe below, this can be done in two basic ways).

#### Reduction Technique

Get a ruler, a marked bench scraper, a chopstick, or something else with markings on the side and take note of how far up the measuring device the current mixture goes. As the mixture reduces, keep an eye on how far it's reduced by looking at the measuring device once more. This prevents the need to pour off the hot mixture into a measuring cup.

The goal is to **reduce to the mixture to about 1/3 of it's original volume**. Using a simple example from the ratio above, if you used 4oz Apple Cider Vinegar and 1 oz Maple Syrup, you'd be looking for a little more than 1.5oz of final mixture.

As it cools, the mixture will thicken up and become more viscous.

## Why You Should Make This

The [Old-Fashioned](https://www.liquor.com/recipes/bourbon-old-fashioned/) has a myriad variants, and for the most part they all are built of the same parts. A healthy pour of base spirit, a small dose of sweetener, a few dashes of bitters, and some essential oils expressed from a citrus peel. The only _brightness_ or acidity offered to the drink usually is in the form of the citrus expression.

The Scrub-Jay cocktail flips that paradigm on its head by reducing a sour ingredient down to a syrup. It's _just_ acidic to make the drink feel a little lighter, but it's still sweet enough to act as a syrup and sweetener. You get some of the refreshingly sour aspect of a shaken drink without the citrus juice.
