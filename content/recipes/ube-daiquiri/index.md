While it's commonplace to see Ube-flavored baked goods these days, it's still a somewhat uncommon ingredient to use in a cocktail. Ube is [a type of yam originating in southeast Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioscorea_alata), in reality. It's got a sweet potato-like flavor and a stark, deep purple hue. Combined with sugar, it's reminiscent of a lot of flavors: sugary breakfast cereals, cake frosting, malt powder, honey.

## Making the Ube Syrup

{{< figure src="ube-extract.jpg" caption="My preferred ube extract. Available online." >}}

Using Ube extract in a syrup form is quick and easy, but be very careful: It's great at instantly staining _anything_ it touches. Preferably, do any measuring/combining over a sink or plastic cutting board. Don't wear white.

If you've not made 1:1 simple syrup before: Combine equal parts sugar and water (by volume or weight, the difference is minimal) in a small saucepan and gently heat over medium-low until all sugar is dissolved. Take off the heat and let cool before saving in a bottle, jar, or other container.

To make the Ube syrup, add **1tsp ube extract for every 6oz of simple syrup**. This can be scaled up or down at the same ratio (roughly 36:1 syrup to extract). Using less Ube gives a more vibrant purple color to the finished drink, but a noticeably weaker Ube flavor.

## Why You Should Make This Recipe

The taste of the Ube syrup imparts a very unique, fun sense of nostalgia for sweets. Cake frosting comes to mind, but also baked goods, sweet pastries. There's something uniquely bready or malty about the flavor that's hard to pin down.  It's delicious and comes as quite a surprise when seeing the inky, opaque look of the drink.

Give it a whirl!
