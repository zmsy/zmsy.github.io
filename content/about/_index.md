## Who Even Writes This Stuff?

<hr>

I'm a software engineer and a data/statistics enthusiast. Fan of dogs. Enjoy tinkering and using my hands. Love wandering out in the woods. I like to create food and drink recipes.

### Purpose 

Shameless self-promotion.

## Site Architecture

Created with:

- **hugo** - Static site generator, build JS via [`esbuild`](https://esbuild.github.io/).
- **bulma + scss** - My preferred flexbox-based CSS framework, with customizations.
- **github actions** - For building & deploying to S3.
- **preact + zustand** - Lightweight frontend UI tooling.

## Artwork & Photography 
<hr class="hr-subtitle">

Unless otherwise noted, all of the artwork, photos, diagrams, charts and graphics posted here on the sites are created by me, with the sole intent of being displayed here for your enjoyment.
