recipeIngredients:
  - 1 3/8 cup (312g) White sugar
  - 1/2 cup + 2tbsp (140g) Butter (unsalted)
  - 1/4 cup (25g) Milk powder
  - 1/2 tsp Kosher Salt
  - 2 Eggs
  - 3 tsp (10g) Vanilla Extract
  - 1 1/2 cups (200g) All-purpose flour
  - 1/2 tsp Baking soda
  - 2 cups Walnuts (rough chopped) (170g)
  - Flaky sea salt, such as Maldon, for topping
recipeInstructions:
  - "Add butter to a saucepan over medium-low heat until it's just short of browned (Watch for butter sputtering and bubbling to die down slightly). Add the milk powder, mix until fully incorporated and let brown until it takes on a caramel color and smells nutty and fragrant, about 1-2 minutes. Remove from the heat."
  - "Add sugar into the base of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Pour in the melted butter and turn the mixer on until homogenized. Allow 1-2 minutes to ensure butter has cooled. Add in the eggs and vanilla extract and mix. Add the flour, baking soda, walnuts, and salt. Mix until just combined. Wrap dough and let chill in the fridge for 1 hour and up to overnight."
  - "Preheat oven to 350F. Scoop the cookies into roughly 1-inch dough balls. Sprinkle flaky salt liberally onto each. Bake the cookies 13-16 minutes or until crispy on the edges and soft in the center. Let cool and enjoy!"

My goal with these cookies is to distill the brown butter-iest taste possible.

[Milk Powder](https://shop.kingarthurbaking.com/items/bakers-special-dry-milk) is the key here. These cookies utilize the same technique that browning butter does, which I've seen in a few forms recently. You can see recipes where [extra milk powder is added while browning butter](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/ultimate-brown-butter-rice-krispies-treats-recipe) or where the milk powder is [toasted separately in a pan](https://alittlespoon.com/chocolate-chip-cookies-with-toasted-milk-powder/). In my testing, I've found that browning it with the rest of the butter in a saucepan is the most predictable route.

I'd used this technique before in a chocolate chip cookie, but I'd noticed the bitter, dark chocolate taste was still the primary flavor (even if they did taste wonderful). I wanted the toasted milk flavor to be front-and-center. Top billing.

## Browning the Butter

Butter is browned by heating it, so that the milk solids caramelize. When you're using milk powder, it's roughly the same process with additional added milk solids.

Using a saucepan, you can brown butter [the way you normally would](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/how-to-brown-butter/).

Here's my approach:

1. Add butter to a saucepan over medium heat and, holding the pan handle, gently swirl the butter once melted.
1. Bubbles will form and the water will evaporate off. When the bubbles cool down and you notice the solids in the butter turning caramel color (Tip: Angle the pan up and "baste" the butter to the other side to get a clearer view), shut off the heat.
1. Pour the butter off into a separate container to cool down and prevent burning.

You _can_ burn the milk solids in the butter by heating them too much. If you've burned them, the resulting color will be very dark, and readily apparent when tasting. If you're wondering whether you've gone too far, your taste is the best judge!

## Watch that rise and spread!

These will puff up in the oven like they're a snickerdoodle, but give them some time to cool afterwards and they'll look like chewy chocolate chip cookies or sugar cookies. You get that delicious, crispy bottom with a gooey, caramel-like center.

15 minutes or so out of the oven should be enough.
