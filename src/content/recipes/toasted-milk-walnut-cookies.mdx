recipeIngredients:
  - 1 3/8 cup (312g) White sugar
  - 1/2 cup + 2tbsp (140g) Butter (unsalted)
  - 1/4 cup (25g) Milk powder
  - 1/2 tsp (3g) Kosher Salt
  - 2 Eggs
  - 3 tsp (10g) Vanilla Extract
  - 1 1/2 cups (200g) All-purpose flour
  - 1/2 tsp (4g) Baking soda
  - 2 cups Walnuts (rough chopped)
  - Flaky sea salt, such as Maldon
recipeInstructions:
  - "Add butter to a saucepan over medium-low heat until it's just short of browned (Watch for butter sputtering and bubbling to die down slightly). Add the milk powder, milk until fully incorporated and let brown until it takes on a caramel color and smells nutty and fragrant, about 1-2 minutes. Remove from the heat."
  - "Add sugar into the base of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. If you've oven-toasted your dry milk powder instead, add it in now. Pour in the melted butter and turn the mixer on until homogenized. Add in the eggs and vanilla extract and mix. Add the flour, baking soda, and salt and mix until just combined. Wrap dough and let chill in the fridge for 1 hour and up to overnight."
  - "Preheat oven to 350F. Scoop the cookies into roughly 1-inch dough balls. Sprinkle flaky salt liberally onto each. Bake the cookies 13-16 minutes or until crispy on the edges and soft in the center. Let cool and enjoy!"

Browned butter is great. These cookies take that browned butter taste and amp it up _even further_. How?

[Milk Powder](https://shop.kingarthurbaking.com/items/bakers-special-dry-milk) is the key here. These cookies utilize the same technique that browning butter does, which I've seen in a few forms recently. You can see recipes where [extra milk powder is added while browning butter](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/ultimate-brown-butter-rice-krispies-treats-recipe) or where the milk powder is [toasted separately in a pan](https://alittlespoon.com/chocolate-chip-cookies-with-toasted-milk-powder/). In my testing, I've found that browning it with the rest of the butter or batching it in an oven is the most predictable route.

I'd used this technique before in a chocolate chip cookie, but I'd noticed the powerful dark chocolate taste was still the primary flavor (even if they did taste wonderful). I wanted the toasted milk flavor to be front-and-center; top billing.

## Brown That Butter, Baby

Butter is browned by heating it, so that the milk solids caramelize. When you're using milk powder, you'll emulate that process using one of these two techniques. The canonical recipe below uses Approach 1, but if you're doubling/tripling the recipe then the second is likely easier. They're both usable with the same volume of milk powder and don't taste particularly different.

### Approach 1. Saucepan

Using a saucepan, you can brown butter the way you [normally would](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/how-to-brown-butter/).

```

Here's my approach:

1. Cut butter into even, 1cm cubes (roughly).
2. Add to a saucepan over medium heat, and stir the butter gently by making a swirling motion with the handle.
3. Bubbles will form and the water will evaporate off. When the bubbles cool down and you notice the solids in the butter turning caramel color (Tip: Angle the pan up and "baste" the butter to the other side to get a clearer view), shut off the heat.
4. Pour the butter off into a separate container to cool down and prevent burning.

You _can_ burn the milk solids by heating them too much, but it will be readily apparent when tasting. If you're wondering whether you've gone too far, your taste is the best judge!

### Approach 2. Oven

If you want to make a large batch of cookies, you can also brown the milk solids in the oven for a less hands-on approach. It's a little more predictable. The recipe as written below uses the saucepan method, but if you want to have the toasted milk powder around for any uses this is a _real_ nice way to do that all at once.

```

1. Preheat oven to 300F.
1. Line an eigth sheet pan with parchment and spread milk powder out on it. Place the pan in the oven and let the milk solids toast for about 10 minutes. After that give the pan a shake and make sure to move the milk powder around. Give the pan another 5-10 minutes until you see the solids turn a light caramel and smell fragrant.
1. Let toasted milk powder cool completely before using.

## Watch that rise and spread!

These will puff up in the oven like they're a snickerdoodle, but give them some time to cool afterwards and they'll look like chewy chocolate chip cookies or sugar cookies. You get that delicious, crispy bottom with a gooey, caramel-like center.

15 minutes or so out of the oven should be enough.
