Browned butter is great. Browned butter with the addition of _more_ brown butter-iness? Please and thank you. I'll take it.

[Milk Powder](https://shop.kingarthurbaking.com/items/bakers-special-dry-milk) is the key here. These cookies utilize the same technique that browning butter does, which I've seen in a few forms recently. You can see recipes where [extra milk powder is added while browning butter](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/ultimate-brown-butter-rice-krispies-treats-recipe) or where the milk powder is [toasted separately and then used](https://alittlespoon.com/chocolate-chip-cookies-with-toasted-milk-powder/).

I'd used this technique before in a chocolate chip cookie, but I'd noticed the powerful dark chocolate taste was still the primary flavor (even if they did taste wonderful). I wanted the toasted milk flavor to be front-and-center; top billing.

## Brown That Butter, Baby

The technique for browning the butter is pretty straightforward here, but there's two ways of going about it. The canonical recipe below uses the first here, but if you're making a lot of cookies the second is likely easier. They're both usable with the same volume of milk powder.

### Approach 1. Saucepan

Using a saucepan, you can brown butter the way you [normally would](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/how-to-brown-butter/). Here's my approach:

1. Cut butter into even, 1cm cubes (roughly).
2. Add to a saucepan over medium heat, and stir the butter gently by making a swirling motion with the handle.
3. Bubbles will form and the water will evaporate off. When the bubbles cool down and you notice the solids in the butter turning caramel color (Tip: Angle the pan up and "baste" the butter to the other side to get a clearer view), shut off the heat.
4. Pour the butter off into a separate container to cool down and prevent burning.

You _can_ burn the milk solids by heating them too much, but it will be readily apparent when tasting. If you're wondering whether you've gone too far, your taste is the best judge!

### Approach 2. Toasting in Oven
