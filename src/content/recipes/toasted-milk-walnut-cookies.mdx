recipeIngredients:
  - 1 3/8 cup (312g) White sugar
  - 1/2 cup (112g) Butter (unsalted)
  - 1/4 cup (25g) Milk powder
  - 1/2 tsp (3g) Kosher Salt
  - 2 Eggs
  - 3 tsp (10g) Vanilla Extract
  - 1 1/2 cups (200g) All-purpose flour
  - 1/4 tsp (2g) Baking soda
  - 1 1/2 cup Walnuts (rough chopped)
recipeInstructions:
  - "If using the oven method (better for large batches), preheat oven to 300F. Add the milk powder onto an oven-proof skillet or pan lined with parchment. Toast the milk powder in the pan for about 10 minutes, give it a stir to move around, and then toast for another 5 minutes. Remove pan from oven and let milk powder cool."
  - "If you're using the saucepan method, add butter to a saucepan over medium-low heat until it's just short of browned (Watch for butter sputtering and bubbling to die down slightly). Add the milk powder and let brown until it takes on a caramel color and smells nutty and fragrant. Remove from the heat."
  - "Add sugar into the base of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. If you've oven-toasted your dry milk powder, add it in now. Pour in the melted butter and turn the mixer on until homogenized. Add in the eggs and vanilla extract and mix. Add the flour, baking soda, and salt and mix until just combined. Wrap dough and let chill in the fridge for 1 hour and up to overnight."
  - "Preheat oven to 350F. "
  - "Bake the cookies 12-15 minutes or until crispy on the edges and soft in the center."

Browned butter is great. Browned butter with the addition of _more_ brown butter-iness? Please and thank you. I'll take it.

[Milk Powder](https://shop.kingarthurbaking.com/items/bakers-special-dry-milk) is the key here. These cookies utilize the same technique that browning butter does, which I've seen in a few forms recently. You can see recipes where [extra milk powder is added while browning butter](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/ultimate-brown-butter-rice-krispies-treats-recipe) or where the milk powder is [toasted separately and then used](https://alittlespoon.com/chocolate-chip-cookies-with-toasted-milk-powder/).

I'd used this technique before in a chocolate chip cookie, but I'd noticed the powerful dark chocolate taste was still the primary flavor (even if they did taste wonderful). I wanted the toasted milk flavor to be front-and-center; top billing.

## Brown That Butter, Baby

Butter is browned by heating it, so that the milk solids caramelize. When you're using milk powder, you'll emulate that process using one of these two techniques. The canonical recipe below uses Approach 1, but if you're doubling/tripling the recipe then the second is likely easier. They're both usable with the same volume of milk powder and don't taste particularly different.

### Approach 1. Saucepan

Using a saucepan, you can brown butter the way you [normally would](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/how-to-brown-butter/).

```

Here's my approach:

1. Cut butter into even, 1cm cubes (roughly).
2. Add to a saucepan over medium heat, and stir the butter gently by making a swirling motion with the handle.
3. Bubbles will form and the water will evaporate off. When the bubbles cool down and you notice the solids in the butter turning caramel color (Tip: Angle the pan up and "baste" the butter to the other side to get a clearer view), shut off the heat.
4. Pour the butter off into a separate container to cool down and prevent burning.

You _can_ burn the milk solids by heating them too much, but it will be readily apparent when tasting. If you're wondering whether you've gone too far, your taste is the best judge!

### Approach 2. Oven

If you want to make a large batch of cookies, you can also brown the milk solids in the oven for a less hands-on approach. It's a little more predictable.
