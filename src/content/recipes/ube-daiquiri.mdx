Been noticing purple-colored baked goods showing up in your local cafe or bakery? That's something ube-flavored, and it's probably delicious. Ube is [a type of yam originating in southeast Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioscorea_alata). It's got a sweet potato-like flavor and a stark, deep purple hue. Combined with sugar, it reminds me of many familiar flavors: sugary breakfast cereals, cake frosting, malt powder, honey.

That's the flavor we want in this drink.

## Ube Simple Syrup

We're going to get ube flavor from ube extract. [You can grab it on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JH4NG6R/) pretty cheap if it's not at your local grocer.

Using Ube extract in syrup form is quick and easy, but be very careful: It's great at instantly staining _anything_ it touches. Preferably, do any measuring/combining over a sink or plastic cutting board. Don't wear white.

If you've not made 1:1 simple syrup before: Combine equal parts sugar and water (by volume or weight, the difference is minimal) in a small saucepan and gently heat over medium-low until all sugar is dissolved. Take off the heat and let cool before saving in a bottle, jar, or other container.

To make the Ube syrup, add **1tsp ube extract for every 6oz of simple syrup**. This can be scaled up or down at the same ratio (roughly 36:1 syrup to extract). Using less Ube gives a more vibrant purple color to the finished drink, but a noticeably weaker Ube flavor.
