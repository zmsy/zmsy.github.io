In this [Old-Fashioned](https://www.liquor.com/recipes/bourbon-old-fashioned/) riff, a vinegar reduction serves to brighten and enhance the character of the (likely dark and barrel-aged) spirit of your choice. The outcome is a savory and lightly sour twist on an old-fashioned.

## Making the Reduction Syrup

For the reduction, you're looking for a **ratio of 4 parts Apple Cider Vinegar to 1 part Maple Syrup**. Alternately, you can sub 20g of sugar for any 1 oz Maple Syrup (if you want to use a different sweetener).

```

```

Starting with a wide saucepan on medium heat, you add in the ingredients to the reduction and simmer them until reduced by the desired amount (notes in the recipe below, this can be done in two basic ways).

```

```

The goal is to **reduce to the mixture to about 1/3 of it's original volume**. Using a simple example from the ratio above, if you used 4oz Apple Cider Vinegar and 1 oz Maple Syrup, you'd be looking for a little more than 1.5oz of final mixture.

As it cools, the mixture will thicken up and become more viscous.
