Year after year, I ask myself: Why?

Why is it that I feel the need to create a best-of list every year for the music that I listen to? Is it that I'm [remarkably afraid of dying](https://thequietus.com/articles/27504-quietus-albums-of-the-year-2019-norman-records)? Is it that I have this cloying need to validate my music taste? Is it because I'm getting older and lack the cultural wherewithal to make insightful judgments anymore?

Of course! All of those and more!

Back again for 2019, here's my best songs of the year:

## The Stars of 2019: 20-1

These were this year's standout tracks.

### 20. Danny Brown - _Best Life_

After many years of experimenting and pushing the boundaries with albums like _Grown Up_ and _Atrocity Exhibition_, Danny Brown seems to be slotting into the same hip-hop veteran style that Snoop wears so well. Through gorgeous production, Brown proves he's still got rhythmic chops but doesn't sound like he's out trying to prove himself anymore. Maybe he even sounds like...he's enjoying it? Either way, it's a good look.

[Video looks like Spike Jonze aping the old-school Ludacris feel in the best way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ov_0M5OxbZM)

### 19. The 1975 - _People_

A brash, unexpected encapsulation of so many tired Instagram mantras from a band of poster children for that particular vein of narcissism. This song's a kitschy embrace of stupid Millenial meme tropes that just never die; [endless 'wholesome' memes about trying one's best, endless apathy and/or never wanting to go outside from perpetual anxiety](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl2-ip3M5ro). There's some truth to all of it all, of course, but hearing them screamed at you over an overwhelming distorted set of guitars just really shows how _hopeless_ some of them sound when taken out of context.

_Wake up, wake up, wake up it's Monday morning and we've only got a thousand of them left_

Coming from The 1975 of all bands is especially ridiculous, but it's effective.

### 18 Courtney Barnett - _Everyone Here Hates You_

Every year, somehow Courtney Barnett makes it onto this list. While I wasn't huge on her album with Kurt Vile, there's pretty much never been a year since _Somes I Sit and Think_ that there hasn't been an appearance here. This one's a bit more upbeat than anything on last year's _Tell Me How You Really Feel_, and it's a nice change of pace.

And also, Courtney release a [MTV Unplugged](https://open.spotify.com/album/2JXEeONIEg6GW3x2uuQDnW?si=hh39E7dcQaGuhBLzNBmR9w) in 2019 and no that's not a joke. And it's good. What?

### 17 Anderson Paak - _Make It Better_

In some ways, my 2019 list looks remarkably like my 2018. There's a Paak tune, Courtney Barnett, familiar faces that just happen to crank out incredible music year after year. In that way, Anderson .Paak has only been improving, as this year's _"Oxnard"_ was a distinct improvement upon the prior year's _"Ventura"_ by nature of having a tighter focus and better songwriting.

### 16 Carly Rae Jepsen - _Want You In My Room_

I am not clued into pop enough to have partaken in the mass internet fervor behind CRJ's 2015 album _"E•MO•TION"_, but there were a few great tracks on that and this year's album _"Dedicated"_. This one thrives on _excellent_ production for a pop song, and it's just catchy as all get out.

The [chorus's back-and-forth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY1RsDpRmIU) with what must be the default patch on someone's Microkorg vocoder just _somehow_ works.

### 15 Snapped Ankles - _Tailpipe_

The first reaction to this song is normally something like "Who the hell is Snapped Ankles and what the heck is this?".

But the front half of SA's album _"Stunning Luxury"_ is pure, unfiltered energy. Reviving a Krautrock _motorik_ beat for 2019 in a way that slots halfway between LCD Soundsystem and Can, this grabbed my attention like almost nothing else this year. There's a bit of a doldrums in the back album where they can't seem to find a good change-of-pace. That first sequence, from "Pestisound (Moving Out)" to "Rechargeable" is hard to beat.

[Seriously, these guys are like, basically not from planet Earth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_X6NfeBCdE).

### 14 Georgia - _About Work The Dancefloor_

Year after year, I look for the song that will dethrone "Dancing on my Own" as the crossover pop hit to define the next several years, and this was the closest anything came this year. Inherits that same energy and adds a unique twist to it.

[Her live take on it (in what can only be described at the "Hotline Bling" room) is a jam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzwUgDm3Jxg)

### 13. King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard - _Self-Immolate_

2019 was the year that Gizz went thrash metal, and I happily followed. Brutal, unparalleled energy from the greatest band down under. I don't know if that means I'm going to start listening to Iron Maiden or Megadeth more, but this is certainly a cool take on the same vibe.

King Gizzard continues to be like no other band in existence.

### 12. Black Midi - _bmbmbm_

_SHE MOVES WITH A PURPOSE_

By all means, nobody should like this song. But try, just try, to not think about it once you've listened. It only gets [crazier when they do it live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoPiihZph9g).

_SHE MOVEESS WITH PUROOSDPROOESHHHJFHJGH_

\*dolphin noises or something, idk\*

### 11. Michael Kiwanuka - _You Ain't The Problem_

Michael Kiwunaka's newest album _Kiwunaka_ instantly grabbed me, and has only gotten better after repeated spins. If I were forced to choose one that I enjoy front-to-back the most of any in 2019, this would definitely be in the running for first place. The instrumentation is gorgeous, the vocal harmonies too. Equal parts _Soft Bulletin_-era Flaming Lips and Kamasi Washington, in a way that sounds incredibly natural. The last time I checked in on Kiwunaka was during his first album, so clearly I've slept on him a bit.

[Kiwunaka was undoubtedly the best appearance on Jools this year, by a wide margin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC-fHfmNLkg) (although Vampire Weekend's version of [Harmony Hall](https://youtu.be/zRlnPNfsbDU) is a notable mention).

### 10. Mark Ronson - _True Blue (Feat. Angel Olsen)_

Unfortunately, I missed this one until after summer was already over, but this is definitely my **#beachjam2019**. Mark Ronson has always been able to pull the best performances out of his features, and Angel Olsen is no exception here. Angel's last two albums have been excellent but are mostly very serious affairs, so it's nice to hear her branch out and have a little fun. Play this next time you're cruising in your drop top down the boulevard on a summer's night.

[I'd kill to find a studio-quality recording of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBOujVlfn4o), but it's still so good even through phone speakers.

### 9. Lil Nas X - _Old Town Road_

Speaks for itself.

### 8. Hunny / Bleached - _Saturday Night_

This is like, wow so 00's emo jam throwback, completed with angsty, over-the-top teenage lyrics.

_Because you're all that I want_

_And every word that you mock_

_Sounds so pretty to me_

_You should die with me, and we can stay in on a Saturday night_

It sounds just about as out of place in 2019 as it would have sounded completely _dope_ in 2006. The phone call-and-response bit at the end is a super novel way to feature a guest artist on your track.

[The video could seriously be an OK Go vid from early Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwLJ548MwTQ).

### 7. Wilco - _White Wooden Cross_

_What would I do_

_What would I do_

_If the white wooden cross meant that I lost you?_

A surprisingly charming contemplation of life and death by Jeff Tweedy; a veteran of making similar topics enjoyable. The summery, distorted steel drum-sounding piano fills in the background sound like they're plucked straight from somber post-rock spin on Beach Boys' _"Kokomo"_.

[Tweedy's solo performance on KEXP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ij5yYfM2Ew)

### 6. Brittany Howard - _Stay High_

The last time I listened to anything by Brittany Howard in earnest was the release of the last Alabama Shakes album, which was several years ago. It was surprising, to say the least, to have this unstoppably catchy number come out in 2019. The vocal harmonies come in right after the chorus are so perfectly timed.

[She's so good that her Tiny Desk puts most others to shame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyW5Zz0w1zg). Shines in the acoustic setting.

### 5. Diiv - _Blankenship_

This song is a grower if I've ever heard one. Diiv channels their inner _Closer_-era Joy Division on this dark track. Grew and grew on me each listen; that _'rat-a-tat rat-a-tat'_ drum fill just before the instrumental break will get stuck in your head.

This band is so far from the band that release _Is The Is Are_ 3 years ago, but it sounds like such a natural transition.

### 4. PUP - _Free At Last_

I'm all about this emo revival. PUP's made some great jams over the years but this one just hits all of the early 00's bits so well that it's undeniable. Plus, this song is hilarious.

_Back at it again, calling in you up at 5AM_

_"Have you been drinking?"_

_Well of cooooooourse I have_

### 3. Vampire Weekend - _This Life_

In the six years since _Modern Vampires of the City_ and Rostam's exit from the band, I was pretty worried that the new Vampire weekend album wouldn't have the same charm and sense of fun that the earlier ones did. It's not what I was expecting, but I can say at least that I was wrong on that front. Charming duets with the ladies of Haim, John Prine-esque porch-sittin' acoustic ditties, silly jam songs. It's a mixed bag for sure, but it's certainly got a ton of great content on it.

_This Life_ stands tall as a centerpiece of it all.

Maybe I'm slightly disappointed that the album name _"Father of the Bride"_ wasn't implying that Quincy Jones (father of Ezra Koenig's long-time partner Rashida Jones) would help produce or something along those lines. Still hoping on that one.

### 2. Better Oblivion Community Center - _Dylan Thomas_

If it's not clear by the rest of the list, I love having artists that I'd previously written off revive my interest. Quite honestly, for all the names I expected on this list for 2019, Conor Oberst (of Bright Eyes fame) was probably the last. But this year, him and Phoebe Bridgers teamed up to make _Better Oblivion Community Center_, which turned out to be one of my favorites of the year. It's the type of album you can imagine buying a physical copy of just because you want to spin it enough times to where it fits like an old sweater. It's great stuff, and this was definitely the highlight.

### 1. Weyes Blood - _Everyday_

This song came out of _nowhere_ for me. Weyes Blood has always been extremely talented, but even off of her excellent new album _"Titanic Rising"_, this one stands out. Much more pop, much more bombast. It's like if you asked Joni Mitchell and Freddy Mercury to team up and write a song that would slot nicely in on the back half of _"Abbey Road"_. Rising strings, Beach Boys-inspired synth patches, Queen harmonies; as a music production stickler, getting to use this song to break in my new speakers was a real treat.

[Some live versions are good, but none compared to the power of the original recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71f19-oLNxM).

## Miscelleneous Other Music Things From 2019 Or That I Discovered in 2019

- [Vulfpeck - Live at Madison Square
  Garden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv4wf7bzfFE) - Best concert video of
  this year by a mile.
- Like a Version blessed us with two of the greatest bits of music this year: Parcel's haunting [cover of Whitney Houston's "I Will Always Love You"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YE6HfTWJQ0) and Denzel Curry's brutal [take on Rage Against the Machine's "Bulls on Parade"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY4ywyFXdik).
- Tiny Desk award of the year goes to [Freddie Gibbs & Madlib performing with El Michaels Affair](https://www.npr.org/2019/12/06/784794979/freddie-gibbs-and-madlib-tiny-desk-concert), adding some much needed soul to some of the tracks from "Bandana". Here's hoping for a Madlib/El Michaels Affair album.
- [Instrumental jams about plants from the 70s](https://open.spotify.com/album/4Pj4zPHuEUPtfacdeTlqUG?si=1GL67WRBTieoMzt7vQlxsw)
- I found the [lost song off of The Avalanches "Since I Left You"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JfTdLmrccQ) (a.k.a. one of my favorite albums of all time) and of course it's incredible. Apparently this never made it because Rogers & Hammerstein's agency wouldn't clear some samples. Lame. Hope it gets included in a re-release.
- [Goodbye Yellow Brick Road](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWePiTJcBEw) cover by Yola (who has [a pretty great album on her own](https://open.spotify.com/album/3YkPGNQ0ATRPcigTb74F5A?si=C08bnPIwRp6NRLC6u_WMzg) produced by Black Keys' Dan Auerbach)
- It's 2019 and Dr. Dre is still not on Spotify. Lame.
- [Don't Dream It's Over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqOGc9ejEXA) cover by Sylvan Esso and Flock of Dimes has got to be the most unexpectedly wonderful one I heard this year
- The best musical moment of the year, by far, has got to be John Oliver's ["Fuck You Bob"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN8bJb8biZU) musical about SLAPP lawsuits from earlier this year. Each point you think it's over, it just gets better.
- Apparently [Alanis Morrissette](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ar7afdfBHj4) was like a 80s mall-pop icon prior to _Jagged Little Pill_. What?
- No room lit up this year like when Kero Kero Bonito [covered Death Grips' "I've Seen Footage](https://youtu.be/RCsXiqaJG1g) _ *"Jesus Is King"* was bad _ [Budos still kills it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-KK6X4xxGs)
- Jai Paul giving up and not providing [a real master of the 2013 leaked album](https://pitchfork.com/news/jai-paul-returns-with-2-new-songs-listen/) is a big disappointment
- One of my favorite remixes of all time, a.k.a. [EPMD - Run It (Duke Dumont Remix)] came back into my life in a big way
- [One of the vampires from "What We Do in the Shadows"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiqjsiGyCYE) wrote a song with Josh Homme for the Desert Sessions album and it's as ridiculous as you might think.
