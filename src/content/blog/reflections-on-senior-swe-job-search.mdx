Chalk up the W! As you read this, I've just signed an offer to start at [Remitly](https://www.remitly.com/us/en).

On Oct 19th, two months into my parental leave with a (very loud but lovable) newborn, I was laid off without warning and without severance after [my former employer collapsed and ceased operations](https://www.geekwire.com/2023/convoy-collapse-read-ceos-memo-detailing-sudden-shutdown-of-seattle-trucking-startup/). I [detailed some of the work I did there earlier](/blog/optimal-deck-chair-rearranging) in an earlier post. I'm glad that I'll have reached some level of stability, and to be able to stop [grinding _f!%$ing_ leetcode](https://leetcode.com/wooly_bully/) for a while.

Since this was my first job search as a a Senior-level (read: 5+ years experience in increasingly responsible roles) SWE, it landed a bit differently than prior ones.

Warning: Some bitterness ahead.

## The Task at Hand

Anybody who's done a programming job search knows this but, in SWE interviews, there's two main challenges:

1. **Coding**, which breaks down into two sub-genres:
    - **Generic** - Usually some sort of coding task where you're given some form of input and told to perform operations on it.
    - **Data Structures & Algorithms** (aka LeetCode problems) - Given a relatively arbitrary question, you're supposed to recite the arcane magic that solves it in the most computationally optimal way, with perfect recall.
2. **System design** - You're asked some questions that are closer to real-life SWE scenarios, and you're theoretically supposed to use your experience and system design knowledge to provide a reasonable solution. In most cases, you'll scale a basic CRUD app well beyond your intended pay grade and then be asked to reinvent complex database tech created by generations of experts.

#### Is That... Really How It Works?

If these tasks seem a little ridiculous for someone primarily building web applications, that's because they are. On purpose. They're not intended to measure how you would do as a software engineer in that organization. They're intended to prove, as quickly as possible, whether the cost of hiring you would bite the company in the behind later.

- Interviewers have an extremely short window during which to make a judgment.
- Since software engineering is a hot industry nowadays, it suffers from a [glut of genuinely unqualified applicants](/blog/career-switch#the-human-aspects). This occurs at all levels, but is drastically worse for junior roles.
- These types of interviews have a wide, verified corpus of questions & answers and companies can draw from them without having to invest in developing their own interviewing materials.

These tactics arose in the FAANG world (who've never _truly_ suffered from a surfeit of available talent) where the bias is to filter out the majority of applicants. Since then, there's been an arms race of smaller companies adopting the same tactics as a signal of engineering prowess.

#### The Interview process

Most of these follow an identical pattern:

1. **Recruiter phone screen** - You'll talk about the mission of the company at large, the composition of the org you're interviewing for, and what you're looking for. They might ask you some basics on your background.
2. **Technical screen** - Usually this is some form of basic coding question that's used to weed out candidates. These are generally pretty straightforward and enjoyable, in my experience.
3. **Interview Loop** - This is a real '[rest of the owl](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/how-to-draw-an-owl)' moment, containing:
    - Coding - Another 1-2 rounds, usually more LeetCode-style or potentially implementing something closer to a real-world data structure (LRU Cache, Typeahead search, etc).
    - System Design - See above.
    - Work Background - How did you approach `$problem`? What would you change?
    - Leadership - [STAR](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/how-to-use-the-star-interview-response-technique)-style questions, about conflicts you've encountered, competing priorities, or other similar topics.

## The Emotional Rollercoaster of Job-searching

Before delving too far in, I think it's probably worth addressing where I was at when I was searching this time around, because it'll color the rest of information you'll see from me.

It was a series of ups and downs.

### The Downs

First the obvious downside: An unexpected job search while caring for a newborn is brutal from a time management and calm nerves perspective.

Second, it's demoralizing. I've struggled with properly valuing my skills after [switching into development as a career at age 29](/blog/career-switch) and not having done the whole CS undergrad plus years of internships route. Knowing what I know now, I don't regret my choices; I had zero idea what I wanted in life in my college years. Still, I do find it a little hard to relate with those who haven't worked outside of the field. My bias makes me feel like that experience is very beneficial, but I've noticed that hiring powers tend to view that time as a distraction.

Third, the sudden burden of studying. It's a lot of work to be thrown into. It takes a long time (weeks at a minimum, I'd say) to come up to speed on SWE interview fundamentals. They're quite different than what you'd encounter in your day-to-day job, and it's probably been a long time since you took your CS 325 Algorithms class.

### The Ups

One of the positives of being laid off among 500+ others is that you've instantly got a job search cohort to work with. So here's what I did:

1. Founded a job search cohort channel on our Ex-Convoy slack.
2. Got organized. Created a google sheet with all of the programming and system design questions I wanted to address prior to going in for tech screens + loops.
    - I used [the methodology put forth by Meta in his YouTube series on interviewing]() where I proportionally allocated about time 40/40/20 to coding, system design and behavioral respectively.
    - Each day would have roughly 3-4 hours of studying with a few breaks interspersed. I think I could've done more but, ya know, baby.
3. 

## Recommendations & Resources

## Reflecting on Interviewing

Some general thoughts, in no particular order:

- The harsh reality in the industry is that nobody will pass your coding interviews for you. If you'd like to work as a software engineer, no amount of rubbing elbows or knowing the right people will change that requirement. You may have a great working history at plenty of respectable companies, but the pervasiveness of bad engineering hires incentivizes companies into adopting practices like those I've described above to test your skills.
- The prevalence of these tactics are reduced for areas where the applicant volume is lower. These companies _do_ exist and likely will ask easier coding questions. If product engineering is the most desired type of SWE role, you'll find these are traditionally in the other areas: support engineering, agency work, wordpress/shopify development, QA,
