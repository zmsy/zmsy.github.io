Chalk up the W! As you read this, I've just signed an offer to start at [COMPANY](https://company.website).

On Oct 19th, two months into my parental leave with a (very loud but lovable) newborn, I was laid off without warning and without severance after [my former employer collapsed and ceased operations](https://www.geekwire.com/2023/convoy-collapse-read-ceos-memo-detailing-sudden-shutdown-of-seattle-trucking-startup/). It's been rough. I [detailed some of the work I did there earlier](/blog/optimal-deck-chair-rearranging) in an earlier post. I'm glad that I'll have reached some level of stability, and to be able to stop grinding _f!%$ing_ leetcode for a while.

Since this was my first job search as a a Senior-level (read: 5+ years experience in increasingly responsible roles) SWE, it landed a bit differently than prior ones.

Warning: Some bitterness ahead.

## The Task at Hand

Anybody who's done a programming job search knows this but, in SWE interviews, there's two main challenges:

1. **Coding**, which breaks down into two sub-genres:
    - **Generic** - Usually some sort of coding task where you're given some form of input and told to perform operations on it.
    - **Data Structures & Algorithms** (aka LeetCode problems) - Given a relatively arbitrary question, you're supposed to recite the arcane magic that solves it in the most computationally optimal way, with perfect recall.
2. **System design** - You're asked some questions that are closer to real-life SWE scenarios, and you're theoretically supposed to use your experience and system design knowledge to provide a reasonable solution. It won't actually be like this though. You'll scale a basic CRUD app well beyond your intended pay grade and then be asked to reinvent complex database tech created by generations of experts.

#### The Interview process

Most of these follow an identical pattern:

1. **Recruiter phone screen** - You'll talk about the mission of the company at large, the composition of the org you're interviewing for, and what you're looking for. They might ask you some basics on your background.
2. **Technical screen** - Usually this is some form of basic coding question that's used to weed out candidates. These are generally pretty straightforward and enjoyable, in my experience.
3. **Interview Loop** - This is a real '[rest of the owl](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/how-to-draw-an-owl)' moment, containing:
    - Coding - Another 1-2 rounds, usually more LeetCode-style.
    - System Design - See above.
    - Work Background - How did you approach `$problem`? What would you change?
    - Leadership - [STAR](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/how-to-use-the-star-interview-response-technique)-style questions, about conflicts you've encountered, competing priorities, or other similar topics.

## The Emotional Rollercoaster of Job-searching

Before delving too far in, I think it's probably worth addressing where I was at when I was searching this time around, because it'll color the rest of information you'll see from me.

It was a series of ups and downs.

### The Downs

First the obvious downside: An unexpected job search a newborn is brutal from a time management and calm nerves perspective.

Second, it's demoralizing. I've struggled with imposter syndrome due to [switching into development as a career at age 29](/blog/career-switch) and not having done the whole CS undergrad plus years of internships route. I don't regret my choices; I had zero idea what I wanted in life at 18 years old. Still, I do find it a little hard to relate with those who haven't worked outside of the field. My bias makes me feel like that experience is very beneficial, but I've noticed that hiring powers tend to view that time as a distraction.

Third, the sudden burden of studying. It's a lot of work to be thrown into. It takes a long time (weeks at a minimum, I'd say) to come up to speed on SWE interview fundamentals. They're quite different than what you'd encounter in your day-to-day job, and it's probably been a long time since you took your CS 325 Algorithms class.

### The Ups

One of the positives of being laid off among 500+ others is that you've instantly got a job search cohort to work with. So here's what I did:

1. Founded a job search cohort channel on our Ex-Convoy slack.
2. Got organized. Created a google sheet with all of the programming and system design questions I wanted to address prior to going in for tech screens + loops.

## Recommendations & Resources

## Reflecting on Interviewing

The over-reliance on LeetCode-style questions seems me to be at best useless and at worst a form of hazing or credentialism. These sorts of operations are _exceeeeeeeedingly_ rare in actual software engineering work.  Most engineers know, internally, that they're going to have a dice roll of a interview process on whether someone asks you to load some data from a CSV and print it to the console, or have to perform some minor miracle to use constant space and linear time for a problem you'll never encounter on the job.

They persist in interviews because the risk to a company is greater by allowing a bad hire than by rejecting a good one. Doing LeetCode well doesn't necessarily lead to applying those same solutions to problems that take the same form in real life, unless you're in a role where it's very obvious from the beginning that you might. Spoiler alert: Most don't.
