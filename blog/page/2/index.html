I&rsquo;m learning a lot every day. If you were expecting some sort of sea change in who you are after you get the job, it&rsquo;s likely not going to be there. It&rsquo;s a new set of challenges.</p><h3 id=youre-good-enough>You&rsquo;re Good Enough</h3><p>The thing that&rsquo;s taken me aback most of all upon switching to a full time software engineering role was how comfortable it feels. There&rsquo;s a lot of practices I held near and dear to my heart on a personal level that have translated well into an engineering practice.</p><p>My takeaways:</p><ul><li>You&rsquo;re likely a good enough engineer.</li><li>You probably know more about engineering as a job than you think that you do.</li><li>Your teammates are happiest when you&rsquo;re resourceful. Research your questions before bugging people. Look for novel solutions. Use what&rsquo;s available to you.</li><li>It doesn&rsquo;t hurt to be open about what you&rsquo;re looking for / dealing with.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t be too entrenched in your opinions.</li><li>The real world of engineering is different than whatever source of information you&rsquo;re reading about online.</li></ul><h3 id=dont-expect-things-to-be-easy>Don&rsquo;t Expect Things to be Easy</h3><p>Like any job, software engineering comes with its own set of frustrations. You&rsquo;re likely going to have to use software you don&rsquo;t want to. You&rsquo;re probably going to have to revive long-dead code that&rsquo;s uncommented and unloved. You may even use unsexy languages / frameworks / approaches.</p><p>That&rsquo;s well-known enough that it should&rsquo;ve been obvious, but until you&rsquo;re there it&rsquo;s much too easy to write things off.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve noticed the things that I struggle with the most aren&rsquo;t even technical challenges. Sure, those are there. The majority of the issues, however, come from trying to be productive as a team. Solving things not just for myself but for the entirety of the organization. If I find a script that helps me debug something, that&rsquo;s great, but it may only help me. Whereas a little bash script you use on your own machine may have been helpful before, there&rsquo;s a lot of added difficulty if you want to share it with others, automate it, or make it a standard practice.</p><p>Motivating and working with groups of people is not an easy practice, and there will always be discrepancies in what people believe is the best approach.</p><h3 id=dont-stop-learning>Don&rsquo;t Stop Learning</h3><p>Software engineering is a role where you can find yourself in a life of learning. Finding the job doesn&rsquo;t mean that part is over, it means you&rsquo;ve just passed the first level.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a lot you can do in your spare time, but the best thing you can do is occassionally challenge yourself to learn something new and try a different technology. I&rsquo;ve found that the times I&rsquo;m most productive are when I can recognized a pattern in one approach based on something I&rsquo;ve done somewhere else. It&rsquo;s a satisfying thing to see your curiosity rewarded, doubly so in programming.</p><p>The obvious suggestions:</p><ul><li>Take a course on Coursera, Udemy, etc.</li><li>Build a personal project.</li><li>Try to see if you can improve something you wrote in the past in a new framework / language / paradigm.</li><li>Benchmark something and see if you can make it faster.</li><li>Refactor an old set of code for maintainability. Make it easier for others.</li></ul><p>This is not comprehensive, nor does it fit everyone, but it should give you an idea of things you can do that aren&rsquo;t just the &ldquo;Get ticket, do ticket&rdquo; type engineering it&rsquo;s easy to fall into. People love to see you excited about things, and being passionate will make you happier.</p><h2 id=whats-next>What&rsquo;s next?</h2><p>Frankly, I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m optimistic.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll follow this up with another check-in at the one year mark.</p></div></div></section><section class=section><div class=blog-post><h2><a class="title title-dark blog-title is-size-1-touch" href=https://zmsy.co/blog/career-switch/>Switching Careers to Software Engineering: A Retrospective</a></h2><p class=meta>written by

After returning to school for CS in November 2016, I&rsquo;ve just emerged on the other side almost two years later. This is the first thing I&rsquo;ve done in my career that feels like it fits how I think and work, and I&rsquo;m planning on making the most of it.</p><p>My approach:</p><ul><li>Move into a semi-technical role where I had better access to engineering (TPM / BI Analyst).</li><li>Start a CS degree. I opted for the <a href=http://eecs.oregonstate.edu/online-cs-students>Oregon State Online Post-bacc in CS</a>, which is an excellent program that I highly recommend.</li><li>Work up a sizable resume of personal projects that prove that you can do the work (I&rsquo;m still working on this bit. This blog is one of those).</li></ul><p>And it I&rsquo;m glad to say it worked!</p><h2 id=three-important-aspects-of-switching-into-software-development>Three Important Aspects of Switching into Software Development</h2><p>Here&rsquo;s the different angles I took on understanding the career switch as I went through it. It&rsquo;s an odd one, but depending on where you&rsquo;re transitioning from, it can be an excellent choice.</p><h3 id=the-learning-aspects>The Learning Aspects</h3><p>Compared to many types of career you&rsquo;d try to switch into, many people switching into CS will be touching a STEM-type field for the first time in their lives. Comparably, it&rsquo;s one of the more accessible sciences to get into because computers are ubiquitous and drive everything in the world today. I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of the last two years just learning as much as I could.</p><ul><li><p>First and most obviously, it&rsquo;s hard. Few people can do it quickly. It takes most people a few years at least. When you hear stories about people who were grinding Leetcode for 3 months and got the offer, know that they&rsquo;re vastly outside the normal distribution of how long it takes people.</p></li><li><p>The problem domain is vast. You quickly get into territory for which there is no set solution, everything has a trade-off, and it&rsquo;s often difficult to espouse why. This is a significant generalization, but the breadth of problems that I&rsquo;ve had to solve in my short time doing software engineering vastly eclipses most roles I&rsquo;ve had or worked with previously. There&rsquo;s so much to know, and you&rsquo;ll likely never be an expert in more than a few small subdomains of the large problem space.</p></li><li><p>There are few, if any, scenarios today where you&rsquo;ll happen to fall into software engineering without significant, dedicated effort. It&rsquo;s common for senior engineers to mention how they may have done this back in the day when they got their start programming for Amiga, Commodore 64, or in the early days of the web. This represents a minority of those career switching into development.</p></li><li><p>There are plenty of ways to get the education for it. Bias showing, I recommend spending the time and money to go to school through an accredited college/university. Boot camps are enticing in that they&rsquo;re quick turnarounds, can get you very career-ready compared to school, and are generally much less expensive. In general, I&rsquo;d be cautious of the drastic uptick in Boot Camps that have sprung up as of late. There are plenty of excellent ones, but there are also enough bad ones to offset those. You may find yourself at a disadvantage for any job that requires a solid foundation in data structures/algorithms/operating systems/etc. Boot camps generally focus very heavily on web development, and usually teach a single ecosystem (i.e. Node/Express, Ruby on Rails, etc).</p></li></ul><h3 id=the-technical-aspects>The Technical Aspects</h3><p>There&rsquo;s a lot of different tech out there and you&rsquo;re not going to learn it all. There&rsquo;s likely a lot of stuff you&rsquo;ll never touch in your lifetime. It&rsquo;s a very wide field with tons of specializations, most of which you&rsquo;ll probably have limited ability to gain meaningful experience in school or boot camp or being self-taught. Seeking out which technologies you want to learn/use is good, but with some caveats:</p><ul><li><p>As a junior, being opinionated about which technologies you want to use will limit your opportunities. If you don&rsquo;t particularly like Microsoft, or don&rsquo;t like Java, you may cut yourself off from gaining experience. You can be selective if you so desire, but it will restrict your career in the short-term. Getting that sexy startup job with 2-years experience in <em>any</em> sort of software development role will be significantly easier than having none.</p></li><li><p>The single most advantageous skill is being resourceful and looking for answers. Good engineers are the ones who can use the resources available too them (Google, stackoverflow, Github, etc) and make decent, working code out of it.</p></li><li><p>Know at least one low-level or compiled language and at least one high-level or interpreted language. The concepts from the lower level languages you learn <em>will</em> be applicable to using the high-level language. Someone using a high-level language may never know why something like copying an array is slow, because they&rsquo;re not aware of how memory works in relation to the code you&rsquo;re writing. Writing C or a similar low-level language quickly eradicates many common misunderstandings.</p></li><li><p>Buy/build a home server or get an AWS account. Start tinkering as a way of learning. Set up some services and have fun.</p></li><li><p>Learn databases and SQL. Most applications you use will interact with a database in some manner. It&rsquo;s easy to get proficient.</p></li><li><p>Get good at setting up your working environment. Having a great local setup using tools you&rsquo;re comfortable with pays significant productivity dividends. There&rsquo;s a reason that developers are so choosy about which tools they like.</p></li></ul><h3 id=the-human-aspects>The Human Aspects</h3><ul><li><p>Managers outside of development won&rsquo;t help your career switch. If you&rsquo;re working on improving your skills to the point where you could start as a developer (by school, code boot camp, etc), they will often espouse support but generally have no idea what that means they should do to help you. Doesn&rsquo;t mean you shouldn&rsquo;t be honest with them about your intentions, but don&rsquo;t expect them to come to you with solutions.</p></li><li><p>Mentorship is exceedingly difficult to come by. You must purposefully seek it out if you want it. If you end up having an opportunity with someone who shares an interest in your future, nurture that flame. Let them know you&rsquo;re interested. It&rsquo;s easy to feel defensive about being inexperienced. This is a nice way to gain some perspective on what that means for you right now.</p></li><li><p>When you hear about software engineer hiring shortages, they&rsquo;re referencing senior engineering talent. Junior roles can often be saturated with new listings all the time, and suffer from a glut of genuinely unqualified applicants. That means people who list things on their resume they have zero experience with, to the point they haven&rsquo;t even done a Udemy tutorial on them.</p></li><li><p>There&rsquo;s a lot of noise out there. Many people, with many opinions (including this one), and lots of people will tell you the best approach. If there&rsquo;s only one thing to keep in mind, it&rsquo;s to be patient with yourself and understand that nobody else is in your exact scenario.</p></li></ul><h2 id=navigating-the-transition>Navigating the Transition</h2><p>Switching into software development these days can feel like jumping on a bandwagon where everyone is smarter than you, paid better than you, and has intense opinions on what is right and wrong. It can feel like an insurmountable hill to climb.</p><p>However, there are plenty out there like myself for which software engineering is an open door to a much better career. Once I&rsquo;ve been in the role for a while, I&rsquo;ll have a part two to this post where I cover my transition period.</p></div></div></section><section class=section><div class=blog-post><h2><a class="title title-dark blog-title is-size-1-touch" href=https://zmsy.co/blog/my-very-own-airflow-cluster/>My Very Own Airflow Cluster</a></h2><p class=meta>written by

I&rsquo;ve used <a href=https://github.com/spotify/luigi>Luigi</a> at work for about 2 years now. For feeding the backend of this website with data, I decided to set up an Airflow cluster.</p><img src=https://zmsy.co/blog/my-very-own-airflow-cluster/airflow.png alt="Airflow screenshot"><p>As opposed to this paradigm:</p><ul><li>Write a script.</li><li>Set it up in <code>cron</code>.</li><li>Check the logs whenever something goes wrong.</li></ul><p>You get a whole lot more bang for your buck, with similar amounts of work. DAG paradigm is more like:</p><ul><li>Write a script.</li><li>Write an airflow DAG, where you call that script.</li><li>Set a schedule for the script.</li><li>Check on it from the built-in Web UI.</li><li>Stop and restart tasks whenever you want to.</li><li>View the console output from the Web UI.</li></ul><p>It <em>really</em> helps certain types of batch processes scale past a certain point, while simplifying the process of managing and deploying them. You can relatively easily set up Airflow to schedule thousands of tasks without all that much more configuration past what you&rsquo;d normally write.</p><h2 id=the-good-and-bad-reasons-to-use-airflow>The Good and Bad Reasons to Use Airflow</h2><p>There&rsquo;s a number of gotchas you should know prior to using one of the DAG engines, as they all fall into the same traps.</p><ul><li><code>cron</code> is <em>incredibly</em> difficult to beat for reliability. There&rsquo;s a reason it&rsquo;s ubiquitous. DAG engines are usually for tasks that need to scale past what <code>cron</code> is built for. If you&rsquo;re just trying to run a single script on the regular, stick with that instead.</li><li>DAG engines are meant for batch programs. If you need anything real-time, look elsewhere.</li><li>Usually there&rsquo;s a non-trivial amount of setup involved at the beginning.</li><li>Sometimes scaling can be a pain. For Airflow, you&rsquo;ll need to setup a task queue like Celery and a number of different nodes (web server, database, etc) once you scale past a certain point.</li><li>There&rsquo;s a <a href=https://github.com/puckel/docker-airflow>relatively mature Docker image</a> that you can reuse if you don&rsquo;t want to configure it yourself.</li></ul><h2 id=diving-in>Diving In</h2><p>There are plenty of ways that you can configure Airflow. There are varying levels of complexity for varying levels of requirements, specified by the Executor types (i.e. what does what in your scenario).</p><ul><li><strong>SequentialExecutor</strong> - Uses SQLite as a backend, and executes tasks for testing/debugging. This is generally what you&rsquo;d run on your own machine if you&rsquo;re just testing a workflow.</li><li><strong>LocalExecutor</strong> - Threaded local executor that uses just a DB connection as a backend.</li><li><strong>CeleryExecutor</strong> - For distributing tasks out to worker nodes. This uses Celery as a queue. Requires you to set up other nodes as worker nodes.</li></ul><p>Here&rsquo;s diagram of how it works.</p><figure class=color-responsive-svg style=height:20rem><svg viewBox="0 0 519 191"

Scaling Airflow is confusing and fault-prone. For those who don&rsquo;t want to deal with the headache of managing the installation on their own, Google offers a <a href=https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/concepts/features>hosted Airflow services called Cloud Composer</a>, or you can look into alternatives like Luigi or Mara. While I don&rsquo;t fully love Airflow, I still haven&rsquo;t found something better.</p><p>Headaches aside, it&rsquo;s still worth using a DAG engine because of the great improvements in both the quality and visibility of batch processing jobs.</p><h3 id=features-to-avoid>Features to Avoid</h3><p>Since Airflow has been in the Apache Incubator for the past year or so, it&rsquo;s been getting a lot of features rapidly. I choose to avoid these ones:</p><ul><li><a href=https://airflow.incubator.apache.org/concepts.html#xcoms>X-coms</a>. The biggest downside of Airflow compared to Luigi is that it doesn&rsquo;t force you to write idempotent tasks in the same way. It&rsquo;s easy to accidentally end up writing something that has outputs which don&rsquo;t reproduce. If you treat a task like a function with a single input and output, it works best.</li><li>Branching Operators - If you need to choose between multiple sets of logic, it&rsquo;s best just to dynamically set your task dependencies at runtime, as opposed to creating a branching task.</li><li>Bitshift Operators as Upstream/Downstream - Airflow recently introduced a way of setting upstream/downstream tasks by using bitshift operators like <code>&lt;&lt;</code> or <code>>></code>. This is bad. Explicit is good! <code>set_upstream()</code> is not particularly verbose.</li></ul><h2 id=in-conclusion>In Conclusion</h2><p>If you&rsquo;re frustrated with <code>cron</code> or other simple ways of deploying batch processes, give it a shot. Be aware of the shortcomings, though.</p></div></div></section><section class=section><div class=blog-post><h2><a class="title title-dark blog-title is-size-1-touch" href=https://zmsy.co/blog/from-gulp-to-webpack-4/>The Switch to Webpack 4</a></h2><p class=meta>written by

The <a href=https://gulpjs.com/>explicit pipelines from Gulp</a> were always significantly easier.

The configuration file is a well-known pain point for Webpack, as it tends to create a lot of headaches very quickly. Being able to replace my ailing, convoluted Webpack 2/3 config files with defaults was appealing to me.</li><li>The move to &lsquo;convention over configuration&rsquo; is approaching. Sane defaults, opinionated by common methods, and tooling built for the majority of use cases.</li><li>Includes splitting into &lsquo;prod&rsquo; and &lsquo;dev&rsquo; modes by default. It was always possible, but this is a major part of the webpack API now.</li></ul><h3 id=the-bad>The Bad</h3><ul><li>Webpack documentation is confusing, sparse, and littered with examples that either make no sense or have been broken by version upgrades.

Since NPM packages take a more Unix-like &lsquo;single function&rsquo; approach, it drastically increases the amount of dependencies per project (this website has 754 dependencies right now).</li><li>Transitioning from a working Webpack 2/3 config to Webpack 4 (either using config or zero-config options) is difficult.</li></ul><h2 id=what-does-it-look-like>What does it look like?</h2><h4 id=previously---gulp>Previously - Gulp</h4><p>Gulp pipelines usually have 1 or more inputs of the same filetype, and then produce explicit outputs using pipes.</p><div class=highlight><pre style=background-color:#f0f3f3;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-js data-lang=js><span style=color:#09f;font-style:italic>// Process main scss for the site.

Turns out people spend their entire lives getting good at these things. I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of research into how to get better at it though.</p><h2 id=resources-used>Resources Used</h2><p>The things that helped me learn PICO-8, by subject area:</p><ul><li><a href=https://neko250.github.io/pico8-api/>PICO-8 API</a> by <a href=https://neko250.github.io/>Neko250</a>. A neat little reference for helping figure out the calls you can make from PICO-8 itself.</li><li><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/pico8/>/r/pico8 subreddit</a> - An exceedingly helpful community of people who are both PICO-8 game designers and enthusiasts.</li><li><a href=https://i.imgur.com/iGrP5bK.png>PICO-8 Cheat Sheet</a> - A quick reference made by the users of /r/pico8.</li><li><a href=https://pastebin.com/AU4JGHqC>Lua for Programmers Cheat Sheet</a> - Admittedly, grasping with the overwhelming simplicity of Lua was a little frustrating at first, but having a slew of examples helped.</li><li><a href=https://github.com/felipebueno/awesome-PICO-8>Awesome PICO-8</a> - One of the curated <a href=https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome>awesome lists</a> that are found on github. This one in particular has a lot of good resources for starting up.</li></ul><h2 id=the-pico-8-interface>The PICO-8 Interface</h2><p>The first place you&rsquo;ll land is the command line in PICO-8, which is used to launch all of the other screens. It looks exactly like you&rsquo;d expect it to.</p><img src=https://zmsy.co/blog/discovering-pico-8/pico-8_cli.png alt="PICO 8 Command Line"><p>There&rsquo;s also a built-in IDE for developing games! This is where you can write your lua code, edit sprites, create background tiles and more.</p><img src=https://zmsy.co/blog/discovering-pico-8/pico-8_ide.png alt="PICO 8 Integrated Development Environment"><p>Multiple other pages in the editor exist for purposes of creating assets for these two pages: A sprite editor, a tile editor, a SFX editor, and a music arrangement screen. Combining all of these, you can make pretty convincing graphics & sound pretty quickly.</p><h2 id=experimenting>Experimenting</h2><p>Since I don&rsquo;t have the depth of experience to be able to make a legitimate video game yet, I&rsquo;m focusing on doing exceedingly simple stuff for the time being.</p><p>There are basically only three functions to know:</p><ul><li><code>_update()</code> - Update the game state. Change objects position, behavior, etc. to match the game state.</li><li><code>_draw()</code> - Give directions for what to draw on screen.</li><li><code>_init()</code> - Initialize game state (only if you need to).</li></ul><p>Using these, I ended up trying to do what most people try to do their first time using any 2D graphics program: make a ball bounce across the screen.</p><img src=https://zmsy.co/blog/discovering-pico-8/pico-8_bounce.png alt="PICO-8 code to bounce a ball.">
<img src=https://zmsy.co/blog/discovering-pico-8/pico-8_bounce.gif alt="PICO-8 bouncing ball"><p>It works! But hey - this isn&rsquo;t interactive, so we can&rsquo;t <em>quite</em> call it a game yet. Here&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;ll do that.</p><ul><li>Add some listening for button presses using <code>btnp()</code>. This determines whether or not a button was pressed that was <em>not</em> pressed during the prior frame.</li><li>Change the velocity based on that button. This time we&rsquo;re adding a random positive velocity to the ball.</li><li>Display some message or feedback so that I can tell I implemented it correctly.</li></ul><img src=https://zmsy.co/blog/discovering-pico-8/pico-8_bounce2.gif alt="PICO-8 bouncing ball"><p>Nice. But now, since this is a videogame we want to update a few more things:</p><ul><li>Run in 60FPS by using the <code>_update60()</code> function instead of the update function. This makes our game run a lot smoother.</li><li>Add more natural slowdowns to the bounces. As the ball bounces off the floor, it should lose some of its velocity.</li><li>Add some more x-axis movement. If the player hits the button, have it send the ball off in some random velocity along the x-axis.</li></ul><img src=https://zmsy.co/blog/discovering-pico-8/pico-8_bounce3.gif alt="PICO-8 bouncing ball"><h2 id=whats-next-to-be-continued-in-part-2>What&rsquo;s Next? (To be continued in Part 2)</h2><p>Now that I&rsquo;ve got the bones in place, I&rsquo;m planning on creating a barebones clone of Flappy Bird for Part II of this blog post.</p><p>What&rsquo;s the way to get there?</p><ul><li>Change the sprites to be objects. The ball itself should have an internal state that captures which sprite should be displayed at any point, and the collisions between it and everything else.</li><li>Functional decomposition. It&rsquo;s easy to write a lot of spaghetti code in pulling together simple demos; the way to scale this is to change the major parts to objects.</li><li>Create wall-generation logic. Flappy Bird works on a randomly-generated basis, so I&rsquo;ll need to create and manage a list of obstacles for the player to surpass.</li></ul><p>Check it out on the next version of this post!</p></div></div></section></ul><div class=pagination><a href=https://zmsy.co/blog/>&#171; Previous</a>
