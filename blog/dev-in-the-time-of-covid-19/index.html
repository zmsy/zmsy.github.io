on 2022-01-20</p><img class=image id=hero-diamonds src=https://zmsy.co/img/diamonds-dark.svg><div class=content><h2 id=been-a-while>Been a while!</h2><p>This is the first post I&rsquo;ve written here since Feb 2020. That was a long two-year gap. There&rsquo;s likely no explanation needed for most. I didn&rsquo;t keep <a href=https://zmsy.co/blog/hugo/>my promise to publish more often</a>.</p><figure><img src=https://zmsy.co/blog/dev-in-the-time-of-covid-19/clock.svg alt=Clock class=no-border style=height:15rem></figure><p>I&rsquo;m usually a voracious learner outside of work. It&rsquo;s partially due to the fact that I&rsquo;m a <a href=https://zmsy.co/blog/switching-careers-to-software-engineering-part-two/>career-switching developer</a>, and for ~3-5 years most of the gains I had in this new track came from extracurriculars. It&rsquo;s also partly due to the fact that I am always usually some combination of bored with current tasks, frustrated with current tech, or curious about new stuff. I am normally able to make time every week to try something out, watch some videos, hammer out some bad code, etc.</p><p>COVID-19 changed all of that. I&rsquo;m also a data junkie to a fault, so I&rsquo;ve been glued to case numbers, virology experts, newly released studies. I&rsquo;ve been fairly cautious throughout most of the pandemic, but I&rsquo;m not immune to anxiety. I&rsquo;ve noticed myself worrying more as I read more. As I became more anxious, I spent less time learning because I found it harder to disconnect. Now that I and my family have been vaccinated, I&rsquo;m hoping to gain some of that patience and willpower to learn on my own again.</p><h2 id=the-last-two-years>The Last Two Years</h2><p>Let&rsquo;s look at the stuff I&rsquo;ve been working with / on.</p><h3 id=typescript-everywhere>Typescript Everywhere</h3><p>This is the major technological development for me over this time. I stumbled on a nascent Typescript around when I started doing web development in earnest, circa ~2016-17. It was far from a sure thing to succeed at that point, but it&rsquo;s absolutely ubiquitous now. 100% of the frontend work that I do is in TS, and plenty of the backend work that I do as well. There&rsquo;s a lot to love here, but I think it&rsquo;s a combination of a few things:</p><figure><img src=https://zmsy.co/blog/dev-in-the-time-of-covid-19/typescript.svg alt="Typescript logo" class=no-border style=height:12rem></figure><ol><li><strong>Ecosystem</strong> - TS adoption is almost ubiquitous at this point. I rarely have to use a library without available types, and when I do it&rsquo;s not particularly difficult to wrap that in my own type-safe code.</li><li><strong>Documentation</strong> - The TS docs themselves are a comprehensive reference. Not very easy to browse/read, but <em>most</em> of the answers I need come from the docs as opposed to Stack Overflow. The only things I have to go hunting for generally are little-used or esoteric.</li><li><strong>Tooling</strong> - TS makes web development in any editor significantly better. VS Code type-checking is comprehensive enough that, once you&rsquo;ve learned the basics, it&rsquo;s <em>easier</em> to write Typescript than Javascript.</li></ol><h3 id=recipe-development>Recipe Development</h3><p>I actually learned to use cooking as my primary means of post-work relaxation during the pandemic. I&rsquo;d learned very early on that it forced me to be away from my phone. It made me use my hands.</p><figure><img src=https://zmsy.co/blog/dev-in-the-time-of-covid-19/recipe.svg alt="A written reicpe next to a cutting board." class=no-border style=height:12rem></figure><p>I started to make the same recipes over and over again. I began to jot down notes about what I&rsquo;d changed and why I changed it. Some is technique, some is using new ingredients, some is synthesizing multiple recipes that didn&rsquo;t quite work for me. I&rsquo;ve been meaning to publish a handful on this site and I intend to do that this year. I&rsquo;ve been learning how recipe SEO works.</p><h3 id=cycling>Cycling</h3><p>Another way I forced myself to disconnect from the world this year was cycling.</p><figure><img src=https://zmsy.co/blog/dev-in-the-time-of-covid-19/bike.svg alt=Bicycle class=no-border style=height:12rem></figure><p>I went from a 1x monthly to a 4x weekly rider. Due to the weather turning worse for the season, I&rsquo;ve slowed my frequency but intend to pick back up again in the spring. For a while, I felt most free and level-headed when I just suited up, threw on a podcast, and peddled as far in one direction as my legs would take me and the sunlight would last. Living in Seattle, I lose the ability to bike in the sun after work during the winters. I&rsquo;ve noticed a drastic effect on my mood from the sunlight, cardio, and general seclusion that comes from riding.</p><h2 id=whats-coming-soon>What&rsquo;s Coming Soon</h2><p>Now that we&rsquo;re into 2022, and I&rsquo;ve been a developer for over four years, what am I going to focus on next?</p><h3 id=web-web-web-web>Web Web Web Web</h3><p>I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed web development most of any type of dev-related work, but I&rsquo;m committing to making this my primary focus. I&rsquo;ve been primarily a backend dev for most of my career. I&rsquo;ve only ever been a frontend-as-needed type of person. In the past two years I cobbled together some meaningful interfaces, and it made me realize the <em>user connection</em> of developing the frontend is invigorating. Feels like I get to make tools useful in a way that the backend work just hadn&rsquo;t allowed me to.</p><p>I&rsquo;m hoping to do some experimentation with some different web technologies, ones that I&rsquo;ve not used before. UI frameworks that aren&rsquo;t React, WebAssembly, newer CSS features, performance optimization.</p><h3 id=being-offline>Being Offline</h3><p>I&rsquo;m working on strategies to be able to <em>not</em> live online all the time. This is a common struggle I&rsquo;ve noticed both in others and myself over the past few years. Even when I&rsquo;m in a time I set aside specifically to work, in a place where I&rsquo;ve got focus, I find it hard not to drift. I think that years of having entertainment be so easily accessed has done a number on my ability to concentrate.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that my favorite part of backpacking (or other off-the-grid activities) is regaining my patience and attention span during those times where I&rsquo;m not constantly drawn away from the moment by my computer or phone.</p><h3 id=creating-learning-materials>Creating Learning Materials</h3><p>My penchant for doodling on this site and my desire to make useful content is bound to collide in some way. I think I&rsquo;m going to look into creating reference materials. I love a good diagram or well-formed cheatsheet.</p><p>I&rsquo;d like to make some short-form, targeted content for learning specific frameworks, language features, or concepts. I am planning on creating a new section of the site for it, but we&rsquo;ll see how that goes. Either way, I&rsquo;d learn something out of it.</p></div></div></section></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class="container has-text-centered"><p id=footer-text><strong>zmsy.co</strong> - A personal blog by Zach Morrissey.
