I&rsquo;m learning a lot every day. If you were expecting some sort of sea change in who you are after you get the job, it&rsquo;s likely not going to be there. It&rsquo;s a new set of challenges.</p><h3 id=youre-good-enough>You&rsquo;re Good Enough</h3><p>The thing that&rsquo;s taken me aback most of all upon switching to a full time software engineering role was how comfortable it feels. There&rsquo;s a lot of practices I held near and dear to my heart on a personal level that have translated well into an engineering practice.</p><p>My takeaways:</p><ul><li>You&rsquo;re likely a good enough engineer.</li><li>You probably know more about engineering as a job than you think that you do.</li><li>Your teammates are happiest when you&rsquo;re resourceful. Research your questions before bugging people. Look for novel solutions. Use what&rsquo;s available to you.</li><li>It doesn&rsquo;t hurt to be open about what you&rsquo;re looking for / dealing with.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t be too entrenched in your opinions.</li><li>The real world of engineering is different than whatever source of information you&rsquo;re reading about online.</li></ul><h3 id=dont-expect-things-to-be-easy>Don&rsquo;t Expect Things to be Easy</h3><p>Like any job, software engineering comes with its own set of frustrations. You&rsquo;re likely going to have to use software you don&rsquo;t want to. You&rsquo;re probably going to have to revive long-dead code that&rsquo;s uncommented and unloved. You may even use unsexy languages / frameworks / approaches.</p><p>That&rsquo;s well-known enough that it should&rsquo;ve been obvious, but until you&rsquo;re there it&rsquo;s much too easy to write things off.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve noticed the things that I struggle with the most aren&rsquo;t even technical challenges. Sure, those are there. The majority of the issues, however, come from trying to be productive as a team. Solving things not just for myself but for the entirety of the organization. If I find a script that helps me debug something, that&rsquo;s great, but it may only help me. Whereas a little bash script you use on your own machine may have been helpful before, there&rsquo;s a lot of added difficulty if you want to share it with others, automate it, or make it a standard practice.</p><p>Motivating and working with groups of people is not an easy practice, and there will always be discrepancies in what people believe is the best approach.</p><h3 id=dont-stop-learning>Don&rsquo;t Stop Learning</h3><p>Software engineering is a role where you can find yourself in a life of learning. Finding the job doesn&rsquo;t mean that part is over, it means you&rsquo;ve just passed the first level.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a lot you can do in your spare time, but the best thing you can do is occassionally challenge yourself to learn something new and try a different technology. I&rsquo;ve found that the times I&rsquo;m most productive are when I can recognized a pattern in one approach based on something I&rsquo;ve done somewhere else. It&rsquo;s a satisfying thing to see your curiosity rewarded, doubly so in programming.</p><p>The obvious suggestions:</p><ul><li>Take a course on Coursera, Udemy, etc.</li><li>Build a personal project.</li><li>Try to see if you can improve something you wrote in the past in a new framework / language / paradigm.</li><li>Benchmark something and see if you can make it faster.</li><li>Refactor an old set of code for maintainability. Make it easier for others.</li></ul><p>This is not comprehensive, nor does it fit everyone, but it should give you an idea of things you can do that aren&rsquo;t just the &ldquo;Get ticket, do ticket&rdquo; type engineering it&rsquo;s easy to fall into. People love to see you excited about things, and being passionate will make you happier.</p><h2 id=whats-next>What&rsquo;s next?</h2><p>Frankly, I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m optimistic.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll follow this up with another check-in at the one year mark.</p></div></div></section></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class="container has-text-centered"><p id=footer-text><strong>zmsy.co</strong> - A personal blog by Zach Morrissey.
