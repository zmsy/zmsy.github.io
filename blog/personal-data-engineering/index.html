on 2019-03-26</p><img class=image id=hero-diamonds src=https://zmsy.co/img/diamonds-dark.svg><div class=content><p>Performing in-depth data analyses on things in my own life have always been more difficult than in my working life, primarily because there I&rsquo;ve normally had teams of engineers who have helped in setting up and maintaining most of the analytics-focused infrastructure that I&rsquo;ve used. Supporting myself with the same sort of infrastructure I was used to was an adventure, <a href=https://zmsy.co/blog/my-very-own-airflow-cluster/>one that started much earlier</a> and has since grown from there.</p><figure><img src=https://zmsy.co/blog/personal-data-engineering/graphs.svg alt="Miscellaneous fake graphs for fun." class=no-border style=width:20rem;height:10rem></figure><h2 id=scope>Scope</h2><p>To most ends, downloading CSVs and plugging them into your spreadsheet software of choice will do most tasks well enough. For my purposes though, I wanted to scale this past what manual analysis was going to get me. There&rsquo;s a few key areas that I wanted this for:</p><ul><li>Personal finances. Most of the data that I create finds it&rsquo;s way into financial systems that are hard to get your information out of. I&rsquo;m not against the bank having my spending data, but I am frustrated that it&rsquo;s so hard for me to get it too.</li><li>Fantasy sports. I love sports and I love stats.</li><li>House shopping. This data is heaaaavily guarded and it&rsquo;s hard to find anything that isn&rsquo;t breaking some sort of ToS to get.</li></ul><p>This doesn&rsquo;t necessarily create a system that requires dedicated data engineering work, but some of the goals that I had for it did. These were:</p><ul><li><strong>Automated.</strong> I&rsquo;d like to see how repeatable and reproducible these analyses can be.</li><li><strong>Modeled.</strong> I&rsquo;d like to build and train some models related to how I live my life to see if there&rsquo;s any predictive benefit to these things.</li><li><strong>Interactive.</strong> - For everything that you see here, I&rsquo;d like to have some sort of interface that I can open, preferably via web browser.</li></ul><h2 id=the-bits-n-pieces>The Bits n' Pieces</h2><p>For doing this sort of work, I set up a few infrastructural components. Hardware is a low-spec server with <a href=https://www.proxmox.com/en/>Proxmox</a> (for VMs) and Docker/<a href=https://www.portainer.io/>Portainer</a>.</p><figure><img src=https://zmsy.co/blog/personal-data-engineering/diagram.svg alt="Diagram of my personal data engineering architecture." class=no-border style=max-height:20rem></figure><ul><li><strong>Postgres database</strong> - My primary datastore. This is the hub of all activity that I do, serving as both an application backend / transactional database as well as an analytical database. Each are neatly separated out into different schemas. I use <a href=https://dbeaver.io/>DBeaver</a> as a SQL client for ad-hoc querying, manipulation, setup, etc. Since a single Postgres instance can scale to vastly larger workloads than I&rsquo;d ever be able to throw at it, this seemed like a good backbone for everything.</li><li><strong>Apache Airflow</strong> - In it&rsquo;s simplest form, I&rsquo;m using this basically as a scheduled job engine. Building on my <a href=%22/blog/my-very-own-airflow-cluster/%22>earlier post about Airflow</a>, I&rsquo;ve expanded my usage of it to a significant variety of different DAGs. This uses the same Postgres database as earlier.</li><li><strong>Jupyter Notebooks</strong> - Interactive analytical code/markdown files served up in your web browser. Jupyter is the ultimate tool in interactive analytical computing, with RStudio being the only major other option I considered (went with Jupyter, if for nothing else, because I find python more enjoyable to write). There&rsquo;s <a href=https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>great options</a> available if you want to run this on a server, I found that I like just running it locally the best.</li><li><strong>Apache Superset</strong> - Web-based Dashboards. <a href=https://superset.incubator.apache.org/installation.html#getting-started>Superset</a>, similar to Airflow, is based on Python/Flask and can be run in a single Docker container if you so desire. Since I need some way of sharing some of these results with a significant other (namely finance + house shopping data), I needed to have some sort of dashboarding software in order to have that visible to someone who will access it via web browser.</li></ul><h2 id=my-workflow>My Workflow</h2><p>Since the pieces have been set in place now, this is my general workflow:</p><figure><img src=https://zmsy.co/blog/personal-data-engineering/process.svg alt="Process workflow from Airflow task to Jupyter notebook and then to Superset dashboard." class=no-border style=max-height:12rem></figure><ol><li>Find a new datasource. Generally, this is something scraped from the web or pulled from a service I use.</li><li>Write an Airflow task to pull that data on a regular schedule (normally nightly).</li><li>In Postgres, create schema / table in order to store info.</li><li>Use downstream in:<ol><li>Superset dashboard. This is normally when I&rsquo;ve created a datasource that I&rsquo;m interested in (i.e. personal spending data) and want to look at from a variety of angles.</li><li>Jupyter notebook. Normally, this is to either create a more in-depth analysis (any modelling required) or to investigate one hunch / idea that I&rsquo;ve got. In the event that I something useful to replicate, I ship this upstream into an Airflow task.</li><li>Exported to some sort of printable / shareable thing. Good example for this is pre-draft research for fantasy sports.</li></ol></li></ol><h2 id=tips>Tips</h2><p>This was a fun adventure to go on, but I&rsquo;m happy that it&rsquo;s stabilized by this point.</p><ul><li>It&rsquo;s fun stuff. It really is. Using data to analyze parts of your own life is something people rarely get to do.</li><li>There&rsquo;s a tradeoff between having a robust, feature-filled system and an easy one. As your needs change, your tools tend to change too. My aims for this outgrew my cron/jupyter/Google Sheets hackjob before trying to take on any of this.</li><li>Getting data is the hardest part. Significantly more time for me is spent writing data fetching tasks than anything else.</li></ul></div></div></section></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class="container has-text-centered"><p id=footer-text><strong>zmsy.co</strong> - A personal blog by Zach Morrissey.
